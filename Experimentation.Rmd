# JMJPFU

This is a Markdown file to experiment various methods in R. 

First we will try the scalaing methods

```{r}
library(caret)

# Taking a subset data for trying

exp_subset <- School_rec %>% select(StudentID,SchoolID,Normvar,Normpop,Population)

exp_subset <- exp_subset[complete.cases(exp_subset),]

# Changing each variable into numeric one by one
exp_subset$Population <- as.numeric(exp_subset$Population)
str(exp_subset)
# Normalising using centering and scalaing

Preprocess_school <- preProcess(exp_subset,method = c("center","scale"))

print(Preprocess_school)

school_transformed <- predict(Preprocess_school,exp_subset)

```
